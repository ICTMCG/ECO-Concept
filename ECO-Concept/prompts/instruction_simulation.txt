 We're studying the concepts used to determine {{tasks}}. Each concept focuses on specific elements in a short document. Look at the summary of what the concept is, and try to determine whether each token in the document is related to the concept. Return 1 for related tokens and 0 for unrelated tokens. You should carefully consider whether each token is related to the concept and not return 1 for all the tokens in the document.
