We're studying the concepts used to determine {{tasks}}. Each concept focuses on some specific elements. First, pay attention to all highly activated text parts in the following example sentences. Then think deeply to find the relations between all the highly activated text parts. Finally, determine whether all these highly activated text parts can represent a consistent concept. If not, please output 'No relation found'; if yes, provide a summary in no more than ten words. The activation format is token<tab>activation. Activation values range from 0 to 1. A concept finding what it's looking for is represented by a non-zero activation value. The higher the activation value, the stronger the match. Format your response as JSON:
{"Summary":"Your summary here or No relation found"}
